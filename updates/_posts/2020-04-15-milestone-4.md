<h1> Public Announcement! </h1>

Announcing PiSign! The digital signage application for the Raspberry Pi. PiSign allows you to create dynamic layouts of widgets to be displayed on a screen. Currently it includes a clock, weather, text, system info, slideshow, and twitter feed widget. By combining these widgets you can create a personal dashboard of information to display. PiSign is also free and open source, so users can contribute new widgets to the project. Checkout [this video](https://vimeo.com/408245509) for a demonstration of the project and its different features!

We are excited to hear feedback from everybody! Feel free to use the Gitter community to discuss issues or problems or use the GitHub repositories to publish enhancements or publish bugs on the issue board.
