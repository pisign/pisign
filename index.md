## Welcome to PiSign

PiSign is a intuitive dashboard targeted towards the Raspberry Pi.

PiSign is a work in progress being developed by students at the University
of Notre Dame.

## Vision

PiSign is an interactive dashboard that will use [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [Go](https://golang.org/) as our main tech stack that allows for the user to customize the layout and see different information feeds via <em>widgets</em> such as time, system info, weather, picture slideshow and twitter. We are excited to use these exciting technologies and allow this functionality to be open and free to everybody!

For more information on our design choices and plan, check out the [following blog post]({{ site.url }}/updates/2020/02/13/milestone-2)!
