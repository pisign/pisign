The goal of milestone one is to make figure out overarching project details necessary as the building blocks for future project milestones.

- How will you maintain a web presence?
  
  We will maintain a [website](https://pisign.github.io/website/) using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)

- Where will you host your code repository?

  We have a GitHub organization [@pisign](https://github.com/pisign) to manage all project related code. Within this org there are currently 3 repositories:
    [pisign-frontend](https://github.com/pisign/pisign-frontend),
    [pisign-backend](https://github.com/pisign/pisign-backend), and
    [website](https://github.com/pisign/website)

- What communal development tools or services will your project employ?

    a. What is your project / issue board?
    
    We are using the built in GitHub project board. We have an overarching board across the entire organization to keep track of large scale objectives, and will track individual code features and bugs in within each repo.

    b. Will you have a wiki?
    
    No, at the moment we do not believe we will create a wiki.

    c. What is your bug / issue tracker?
    
    We are using the build in GitHub issue tracker.

    d. How will you provide real-time communication (ie. chat)?
    
    We have a [Gitter](gitter.im) community setup for our [@pisign](gitter.im/pisign) organization. We have also linked the main gitter chatroom to our website using a [Gitter Sidecar](https://sidecar.gitter.im/)

- What continuous integration platform will your project use?

    We will be using Travis CI for pushing into Github.

    a. How will you test your project?
        
    Travis CI will be testing new code that they pass test cases. Test cases will include unit tests mostly on backend APIs to ensure that they function properly. As for the front-end, we can use Selenium to test that elements are being updated/showing up/functioning correctly. 

    b. How will you deploy your project?
    
    We will be using Docker images to set up the environment. This can be used to deploy the project onto the raspberry pi. As for deploying for the public, we can give them a list of instruments to follow to open up the image and start up the backend and open up the frontend signage.

- Which open source license will you use for your project?

  We've decided to use **GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0** for our project. We believe it is the *safest* option, as it is the most generally restrictive option. We can always decide to switch to an MIT or similar down the road if we so choose.
